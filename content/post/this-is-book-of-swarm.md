Dear friend of Swarm,

We are happy to finally share the [Book of Swarm](https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/latest.bookofswarm.eth/) with you. It’s basically Swarm’s 280-page white paper but with a more groovy title. Book of Swarm is a deep dive into the Swarm protocol. While the Book had been discussed at previous events, such as NonCon, the official announcement and pre-release was a major milestone for the Swarm team.

[Book of Swarm](https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/latest.bookofswarm.eth/), like Swarm itself, is free and open source and available freely for download from the Swarm network itself. Book of Swarm takes a deep dive into the system architecture, specifications, protocols, potential use cases, APIs and the formalizations and proofs underlying the Swarm protocol. Swarm team invites everyone to comment, try the implementations and prove or disprove any of the materials presented.

If you are a fan of Swarm, you will probably already know what it is. For those who just found us, a small recap.

# The Holy Trinity

When Vitalik jokingly talked about Ethereum as being the Holy Trinity, he was talking about the 3 components a system needs to call it a computer. It’s processing, messaging and storage. In the world computer that Ethereum is, Swarm was originally designed to be the storage component. Swarm quickly grew like a beanstalk, while also developing messaging (pss:/). It is currently completing the incubation period where it is fully under the Ethereum umbrella, and emerging as its own independent project, as it is only loosely coupled with EVM and still growing in scope.

# The New Internet

Swarm isn’t just decentralized storage. It is the basis for a new incarnation of the internet, this time being the decentralized web it always was meant to be. It provides a flexible enough framework that any distributed application will use Swarm for storage and messaging, making it a perfect candidate for seeding the new web.

Today, storage is a commodity purchased from different corporations. The problems with using these corporations is the centralization and inability to assure privacy and censorship resistance.

Swarm’s mission is to provide storage that adheres to six fundamental standards:

* Fault tolerant
* Censorship resistant
* DDoS resistant
* Zero downtime
* Self-sustaining
* Privacy first

Basing itself on these fundamentals allows Swarm to be compatible with [Fair Data principles](https://fairdatasociety.org/). Fair Data principles respect the individuals and groups who produce data, and allow those people to have ownership, control and sovereignty over their own data.

We hope we will provide great self-sovereign storage for the privacy conscious and free people, for the free world, instead of corporations making tons of money on our data.

With Swarm, we can achieve this Fair Data Society. Using a cryptocurrency, storage providers are rewarded for their services as well as their helpfulness to other nodes in the network.

# It’s Alive!

Swarm itself is already up and running with upload and download capabilities. At the Book of Swarm announcement event, we presented an early “Bee”, a basic client that allows creation of Swarm network nodes and transactions between them.

# Release the Bees

As with any storage network, Swarm is agnostic to what is stored on the network. Swarm architect and computer science hero Viktor Trón is adamant that the network needs to be as content-neutral as possible. Creating a censorship-resistant network is all about freedom, and Swarm is permissionless, so that it can be multi-purposed.

In the near future, we see implementation of simple applications such as communications and productivity tools. The long-term vision is that an agnostic network such as Swarm will serve for large-scale data needs, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. With respect to privacy and user data, Swarm can implement a variety of incentive systems that allow people to maintain their privacy but also contribute their data to projects of interest that can leverage that data for good.

We can’t wait to update you with more exciting stuff soon at the Swarm Alpha event this Monday ([Register here](https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/alpha.swarm.eth/)).
