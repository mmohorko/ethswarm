**Unstoppable applications need unstoppable storage**

The ecosystem already faces challenges of how to deal with private or big data on the blockchain. Swarm’s features come handy when it comes to access control and privacy and can complement where the blockchain stops. [The Swarm MVP release](https://medium.com/ethereum-swarm/get-ready-for-unstoppable-dapp-development-with-swarm-mvp-852933e32676?source=friends_link&sk=8c649f6ab35bae6c25a3ed7469cbea19) is a step towards providing a fully decentralized environment for DApp devs to get creative and bring their ideas to life.

Watch Gregor’s talk to hear all the details:

**Ok, but who will use those unstoppable DApps?**

Your popular DApp can be unstoppable on Swarm now. With the guarantee that the data stored on Swarm will be readable, you can easily spin up your node and pin the data. But how to onboard end-users without teaching them all the crypto magic? Daniel A. Nagy presented a solution for the zero Eth onboarding problem:

Now that Swarm can be used as a staging environment for DApp developers, a major milestone was achieved on our roadmap towards Swarm 1.0. But this is just the beginning of the year, so get ready for the next big hit: the Book of Swarm. More details are coming within a few days.
