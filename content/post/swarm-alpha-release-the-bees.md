**We got to talk. It’s time.**

We weren’t really quiet, see our updates from [March](https://medium.com/ethereum-swarm/swarm-development-update-march-2020-f63b4782d66?source=friends_link&sk=016fcbc1fd2a3a43129eb271272a5bbb), [April](https://medium.com/ethereum-swarm/swarm-development-update-april-2020-36d763814845?source=friends_link&sk=10695400fff8cfdb667c93a369cc538d), [May](https://medium.com/ethereum-swarm/monthly-development-update-may-2020-1660e0a18137?source=friends_link&sk=b6785133509b24c659afebac39d87c16) or [EthCC](https://medium.com/@ethswarm/towards-the-vision-of-the-world-computer-watch-the-swarm-update-from-ethcc-c11fc4d5f23a?source=friends_link&sk=83d6773684eb4a56a4a57ea2ab4007c2)or [Noncon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tVvMhDqxX0&feature=youtu.be). We pre-released a really cool [Book of Swarm](https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/latest.bookofswarm.eth/the-book-of-swarm-viktor-tron-v0.1-pre-release.pdf). But there’s more.

We’ve been working mega hard in the past months and now we’re far enough to show more.

In the following weeks we’ll be releasing info on how the Swarm project is growing into an organisation as part of graduation from Ethereum Foundation. We’ll present a fine tuned roadmap towards Swarm 1.0. We’ll be talking about what BZZ token is and why it is needed.

## All this leading up to our first public virtual event which will happen on June 29th at 20:00 CEST.

[Sign up for Swarm Alpha: Release the Bees!](https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/alpha.swarm.eth/)

The first 300 sign-up receives a special Swarm NFT.

There, we’ll give an update on future plans. We’ll have some guests. We’ll have the new Bee client, alpha version, official release. We’ll have some demos from teams building on Swarm. We’ll be talking about Swarm grants and how we create the new world together. Because we are all Swarm.

Thank you for being patient.

We hope you will like it.
