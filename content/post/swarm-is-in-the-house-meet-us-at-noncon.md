_Alice: Any plans for Saturday evening?  
Bob: Noncon & chill._ [_Here’s the link._](https://noncon.org/)

Sanitize your gamer seat, calibrate that mic, polish the camera window, and get ready for this Saturday night in, brought to you by [Noncon](https://noncon.org/) where the Swarm Team is going to participate and present.

In the times of now, we are increasingly confronted with the dilemma of leveraging the power of data vs. preserving privacy and human rights. A new paradigm for the data driven world we live in is needed. Fair Data Society presents an alternative vision, the world of self-sovereign data commons.

Join us on Saturday at 20:30 CET listening to Gregor Žavcer presenting Fair Data Society’s latest campaign, a privacy-centric, fair data approach to tracking COVID-19 by building on Swarm.

4th April, Saturday, at 21:20 CET Viktor Tron will invite you to enter the Secret World of Acronyms, Riddles and Mnemonics with a much anticipated talk that announces the Book Of Swarm. If you’ve ever wondered what’s the difference between Swarm and IPFS, how Swarm’s DISC model compares to a DHT then this is THE TALK that you need to listen to. Let’s take a deep dive into the fair data tech stack with Viktor and explore Swarm’s solution for permissionless publishing, distributed storage and private communication, which is incentivised, decentralised and secure.

Stay safe and come to Noncon! See you all this weekend ❤
